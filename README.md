- Does it solve the basic case?

Yes


- What other cases might need to be considered?


- What unit tests might you write for this type of function?

1: If empty array is passed then it shows B. Where no amount is passed. we can display error that aray is blank

2: If only length is one then same case occurs that it can not calculate difference.Only one value is passed.

3: If we passed garbage value then it should show error also


We're not looking for a 100% full proof solution (which might not exist anyway depending on the use case).
